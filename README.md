This package is a module for simulating dynamic 1D and 2D heat transfer processes by using the finite difference method. The packages is based on thermal objects. Two different approaches can be used: single thermal object and a system of thermal objects that can contact with each other. Unlike the majority of software packages, heatrapy includes both the modeling of caloric effects and the incorporation of phase transitions.
